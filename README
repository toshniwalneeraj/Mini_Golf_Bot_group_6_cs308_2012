Project Description
-------------------
The aim of the project is to design a golf playing bot. The game is played on a 4ft x 4ft plywood arena covered with velvet.
Given a hole marked by a blue flag and red foosball,the bot will try to hit the ball as accurately as possible.
The project was divided into many tasks and each task was handled separately and then merged finally.Major part
of the project was making of the required hardware.

Camera was attached at the top of the bot which aims at capturing a image in which the ball is in centre of the frame.
On finding it, it moves towards the ball and searches for blue flag and on success, it align itself in such a way so that
bot, ball and flag are collinear. Angle of inclination of inclined plane is computed from capturing the seemingly height
of the flag from the frmae captured. Once it is calculated the angle of inclination plane is set and ball is allowed to 
roll freely. If ball enters the hole the game ends otherwise the above procedure is repeated.
